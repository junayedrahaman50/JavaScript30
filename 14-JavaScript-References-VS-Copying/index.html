        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Lux'; // team is refrence to the original array players, upon updating an element of team it will update the original array 

        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice(); // slice will give us copy of original array

        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players); // also gives a copy of original array

        // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players]; // also gives a copy
        team4[3] = 'Great Team';
        console.log(team4);

        const team5 = Array.from(players);
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person; // captain is a refrence of person
        captain.number = 99;

        // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 }); // copy of person
        console.log(cap2);

        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        const cap3 = { ...person }; // spread object

        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
